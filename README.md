## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
The Hardware portion of an amazon purchase is using a physical device to make an online purchase. People then are using the premade software to make a purchase by the software making its instructions and telling the hardware what to do. You then have to put in your information to make the online purchase which is called data. The data is the stored information such as your address, payment info, name, zip code etc. The people that are involved with making the online purchase are the Amazon Employees that made the software so that people are able to make an online purchase. When making an online purchase through Amazon, you must go through a process or a series of steps to making said purchase. These steps include: adding items to the cart, checking out, putting in information, then confiriming your purchase. 
### Software
#### GitHub
My experience with working with GitHub so far has been Stressful. I am normally pretty good with technology but this seems to be a little more difficult than usual. With cloud computing, it makes doing things online easier because it gives me mobile access to what I need. It is also helpful that we are able to be on a client server. Although we are not on a LAN, we are still on a server that allows us to directly connect with each other online. 
#### Screen Capture
The Software Association I utilized is the snipping tool. The name of the file is ScreenCapture. The Software Size is: 873KB. 
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
Operating Systems: Operating system software is software that is necessary on all computing devices to make your devices work. It is very essential because it makes your computers function. Examples of operating systems include Microsofts Windows, and Apple's Mac OS. 
Application Software: Application software is software that is made to accomplish specifc tasks that the user wants to do. Examples of applications would be word processing, calcualting on a spreadsheet, and using a specific browser to look things up on the internet. 
Utility software: Utility software is the software that makes a user able to modify their computer in many different ways. An example of this software is anti-malware software and programs. This software will remove software you no longer want installed. 
#### ERP
The purpose of ERP was to make it so that there was an entire organization within one program. An example of a company that uses this software is Microsoft but there are many small and medium sized companys that use this system as well. 
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is technology that was made to make you get the most out of one device. Instead of making one device do 1 task, you can make 1 device do 3 tasks simaltaniously. A simple example of this can be using an Xbox console to not only be able to play video games, but you can put a blue-ray player in it so it can also play movies. 
Hypervisor: A hypervisor is a software that creates and runs virtual machines. This was made to give users access to computers that performed batch processing. 
#### Python
Python is an easy to learn programming lanuage. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs.
The first program in discussion is writen in a compiled language like C or C++. This language has to be converted so that way your computer can understand it. The big difference with this program and Python is that Python does not have to converting anything at all. All you have to do is run the program and Python will do all of the work. 
Python1: Python1 is the edit of the text to say "Hello, Dylan Hegedis"
Python2: Python2 is the creation of a short program based on what I learned. 
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
The difference between rastor and vector imaging is that rastor images lose quality when you enlarge them, where as vector images dont lose quality at all and it does not matter if you make the photo larger or smaller. Knowing the difference of Lossless and Lossy compression is important for web developers because lossless compression does not get rid of any of the data perserved while lossy compression does. 
JPEGS are more for storing full color images and more complex images. 
GIFS are made for people that want animated imaging.
PNG supports transparency options like alpha channel transparency. 
#### File Compression
The Purpose of File Compression is to make it so that what you are sending is smaller in size. This makes the file faster to download and less time to upload. The file size before compressing the SVG grapghic was 147KB. After compressing it, it was then 20KB. The difference in size was 127KB and I think I expected the differencial to be less because I did not know that it could shrink it to be that small. 
#### Artificial Intelligence

### Career Exploration
#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
So far I have seen the Job titled "Computer Support Specialist" that has interested me. Also, Computer System Analysts interesed me as well. 
#### Handshake
I think that Hanndshake is a very good resource to find a job. I saw a position for the Cleveland Guardians that was cool but I do not have the required specifications yet to pursue something like that. 
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees
After looking over the 3 links, I think that the one that interested me the most was the Cisco certificate. Also, after looking at the Tri-C certificates. I noticed that we also have classes for a Cisco short term certificate which is interesting to me as well. 
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
An Organization that would be useful for me on my resume would be the Phi Thetta Kappa Organization. They would be beneficial because they are an hours program so employers might look at this and see that and possibly consider me over other people. 
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The purpose of the CPU is that it functions as the brain of a computler. The ALU performs all of the math inside of a CPU. 
When using a self-checkout machine at a grocery store, you are using a big computer to check out. It does many different tasks as well. The main 4 functions of a computer are imput, store, process, and output. You are imputting your items barcodes on the scanner and you then imput your payment method. The machine stores all your items bercodes and payment info in its system temporarly. The machine then processes the items scanned and calulates the price using the ALU. Then it outputs with finalizing your order and giving you a reciept.  
#### Gates and Circuits
A truth table is a table that shows every possible output for all of your inputs you put in. An AND Gate is that your imputs have to be the same to get the same output. An OR Gate is a gate that doesn't matter if you have the same 2 inputs, you can still have the same output.
#### IEEE
IEEE's core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. In their code of ethics, they commit to uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. They also state to To treat all persons fairly and with respect, to not engage in harassment or discrimination, and to avoid injuring others. Lastly, they say they strive to ensure this code is upheld by colleagues and co-workers.
#### Storage
Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek. The disk transfer rate is the time it takes from data to go from the disk to the system. 
The difference between SSD's and Traditional Hard Drives is that SSD's use chips that use flash memory which is much faster than the regular hard drive. 
#### Memory
The Ram is important because it is used so that way computers can access data and actually be able to use and run the data. By increasing your RAM, you are decreasing the amount of time that the data has to go from the hard drive and back which then in turn will make your computer process way faster. The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths is how much data is transfered in 1 clock cycle. This also affects the speed of the computer based on the bit paths you have. 
A difference between RAM and hard disk storage is that RAM moves things much faster than the hard disk. Another difference is that the RAM does not hold data for long periods of time. The hard disk storage is what is used for holding data for long periods of time unlike the RAM. 
#### Data Representation
Decimal representation is showing a number in decimal form aka. Base 10 (ex.1450)
Binary representation is showing a number in the form of 1's and 0's/ only 2 digits (ex.10011001)
Hexadecimal representation has a base of 16/ has 16 digits. (ex. 0123456789ABCDEF)
3DecimalConversion.png: the file of putting 198 into Binary representation
4BinaryConversion: conversion of binary form to decimal form 
The color being shown is a custom color with the description name "Vivied Violet". This color could be problematic because it is a custom color so people would not know the true identity of the color. What needs to be considered is people that have color insensitivity. 
#### Operating Systems
I typed md IT1025DylanHegedis, then I typed cd to change the directory of my new folder. I then typed dir to get the list and then took a screenshot to show my work. 
### Networking
#### Data Transmission
Protocol is the set of rules to allow devices to communicate.
Packet is the unit of data 
IP Address is the unique identifying number
Packet Switching is technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on their destination address. 
DNS is Directory of websites on the internet 
#### Hardware
The Benefit of a Switch over a Hub is that a Switch can send information to 1 specific place unlike a Hub. It is better for security reason and also lowers network Bandwith. 
A Router is better than both of the other devices because it can send data outside of its local area network because it can store IP Addresses to send the data to. 
#### Topologies and Types of Networks
A Single Point failure is when a hub or a switch fails to transfer data. This single point failure can affect the Star topolgy,and the Ring topology. 
The Wireless mesh of the option that would be more efficient to use. The reason for this is because it is less work with wiring to do the same thing. You also would not have to worry about the wires breaking as well. 
NETWORK DESIGN:
I used the network design called Infrastructure. I made it by putting the modem connecting to the router. The routher then connected to a pc via ethernet cable and it also connected to a wireless router which then connected to another pc and a printer in a different location. 
#### Protocols
Communication: Communication protocols allow different network devices to communicate with eachother. an example of this is instant messaging. 
Network Management: Network management protocols define and describe the various procedures needed to effectively operate a computer network. An example of this is troubleshooting which is idenfifying an issue through a series of tests. 
Security: Security protocols were made so that people and send data without having to worry about someone else seeing it if they don't want others to. An example of this is Entity Authentication. Entity authentication protocols create a system that requires different devices or users on a network to verify their identity before accessing secure areas.
IP Adress: IP Adresses are unique numbers that are assigned to every device that is connected to the internet. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv6 has a massively bigger address space than IPv4. 
ICANN: ICANN allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRS) around the world. They are a non-profit organization that coordinates the maintenance and procedures of several databases of the internet. 
HTTP is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages. It is an example of a client-server model by it starting from the computer then going through the public internet and then to the server. HTTPS is a secure feature that is used on some websites. It is usually used when people and sending over personal information. Another option that is used to secure data that goes across the interent is SSL. It uses public key encription to secure the data. TLS is the successor to SSL and is what is majorly used today. It does similar tasks such as authenticating and encrypting as well. 

### Cybersecurity and Encryption
#### Security Triad
I am not sure where I was supposed to get the information for this question from but the secuirty for medical records such as MyChart has to be very locked down because medical records are very personal and private information to keep. 
#### Caesar and Polyalphabetic Ciphers
Polyalphabetic cipher is to flatten the distrubution of letter frequencies. It is labeled in numbers based on the position it is in the alphabet. Then, the numbers are shifted according to the numbers below it. Ceaser cipher does not do as good of a job at distributing frequencies and moved the main letter 3 letters to the right of the original letter. 
My Encription was moved 4 spaces to the right to say: wulf kdv d fbehuvhfxulwb fhuwlilfdwh
#### Public and Private Key Encryption
With public encryptions, everyone who is listening knows 1 specific detail. To make it a private encryption, the 2 people involved make a secret code to mix in which is then decrypted by the other person to then be able to share with one another. The people listening dont get the full code so they are left wondering what the code actually is. 
#### Brute-Force Attacks
A way to signal that you are under attack is getting a notification that you have several failed login attempts. 
A way to defend online attacks is for an operator to add rate-limiting. This slows down a hacker even more than they are already slowed. A VPN is also a great way to help from getting online attacked as well. 
More ways to prevent these attacks are to have long passwords, use two factor-authentication as well. 
What i also found interesting was this: "2013: GitHub users are the victims of an online brute force attack"
A couple ways to defend Offline attacks is salting and hashing. 
### Internet Programming
#### Components of a URL
Scheme:HTTPS
Domain:www.amazon.com
Top Level Domain:.edu 
Default Page:result of search 
Parameters:no file path provided
Anchor:specific location on a page
#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the world wide web. He invented W3C to improve the quality of the web. 
The Standard "Web of Devices" seems like it is an important standard to have around. It is important because it allows people to have access to the web form virtually anywhere, anytime. 
### Software Development
#### Algorithms
A Variable is like a box that can store a single value. He uses examples like spam, eggs and bacon because they are often used in Python Tutorials. 
An Assignment Statement assigns a value to a name. 
A function is a named section of a code that performs a specific task. 
The 3 Data Types are integers,Floats, and Strings 
#### Object Oriented Concepts
The attributes for the shark class is swimming and being awesome. The methods are the functions that are indented underneath the class. The constructor's purpose is to intialize the data. The difference between a class and an object is that an object is an instance of a class. You take the class and then you use it to create an object or instance of it. 
### Database Systems
#### SQL, NoSQL, and Big Data Technologies
#### Data and Business Decisions
#### The relational model and Normalization
#### SQL Injections

### Legal and Ethical Responsibilities in Computing
