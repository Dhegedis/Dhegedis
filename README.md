### Information System Components
The Hardware portion of an amazon purchase is using a physical device to make an online purchase. People then are using the premade software to make a purchase by the software making its instructions and telling the hardware what to do. You then have to put in your information to make the online purchase which is called data. The data is the stored information such as your address, payment info, name, zip code etc. The people that are involved with making the online purchase are the Amazon Employees that made the software so that people are able to make an online purchase. When making an online purchase through Amazon, you must go through a process or a series of steps to making said purchase. These steps include: adding items to the cart, checking out, putting in information, then confiriming your purchase. 
### Software
#### GitHub
My experience with working with GitHub so far has been Stressful. I am normally pretty good with technology but this seems to be a little more difficult than usual. With cloud computing, it makes doing things online easier because it gives me mobile access to what I need. It is also helpful that we are able to be on a client server. Although we are not on a LAN, we are still on a server that allows us to directly connect with each other online.
