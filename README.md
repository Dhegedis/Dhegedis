## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
The Hardware portion of an amazon purchase is using a physical device to make an online purchase. People then are using the premade software to make a purchase by the software making its instructions and telling the hardware what to do. You then have to put in your information to make the online purchase which is called data. The data is the stored information such as your address, payment info, name, zip code etc. The people that are involved with making the online purchase are the Amazon Employees that made the software so that people are able to make an online purchase. When making an online purchase through Amazon, you must go through a process or a series of steps to making said purchase. These steps include: adding items to the cart, checking out, putting in information, then confiriming your purchase. 
### Software
#### GitHub
My experience with working with GitHub so far has been Stressful. I am normally pretty good with technology but this seems to be a little more difficult than usual. With cloud computing, it makes doing things online easier because it gives me mobile access to what I need. It is also helpful that we are able to be on a client server. Although we are not on a LAN, we are still on a server that allows us to directly connect with each other online. 
#### Screen Capture
The Software Association I utilized is the snipping tool. The name of the file is ScreenCapture. The Software Size is: 873KB. 
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
Operating Systems: Operating system software is software that is necessary on all computing devices to make your devices work. It is very essential because it makes your computers function. Examples of operating systems include Microsofts Windows, and Apple's Mac OS. 
Application Software: Application software is software that is made to accomplish specifc tasks that the user wants to do. Examples of applications would be word processing, calcualting on a spreadsheet, and using a specific browser to look things up on the internet. 
Utility software: Utility software is the software that makes a user able to modify their computer in many different ways. An example of this software is anti-malware software and programs. This software will remove software you no longer want installed. 
#### ERP
The purpose of ERP was to make it so that there was an entire organization within one program. An example of a company that uses this software is Microsoft but there are many small and medium sized companys that use this system as well. 
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is technology that was made to make you get the most out of one device. Instead of making one device do 1 task, you can make 1 device do 3 tasks simaltaniously. A simple example of this can be using an Xbox console to not only be able to play video games, but you can put a blue-ray player in it so it can also play movies. 
Hypervisor: A hypervisor is a software that creates and runs virtual machines. This was made to give users access to computers that performed batch processing. 
#### Python
Python is an easy to learn programming lanuage. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs.
The first program in discussion is writen in a compiled language like C or C++. This language has to be converted so that way your computer can understand it. The big difference with this program and Python is that Python does not have to converting anything at all. All you have to do is run the program and Python will do all of the work. 
Python1: Python1 is the edit of the text to say "Hello, Dylan Hegedis"
Python2: Python2 is the creation of a short program based on what I learned. 
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
#### File Compression
#### Artificial Intelligence

### Career Exploration
#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
So far I have seen the Job titled "Computer Support Specialist" that has interested me. Also, Computer System Analysts interesed me as well. 
#### Handshake
I think that Hanndshake is a very good resource to find a job. I saw a position for the Cleveland Guardians that was cool but I do not have the required specifications yet to pursue something like that. 
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees
After looking over the 3 links, I think that the one that interested me the most was the Cisco certificate. Also, after looking at the Tri-C certificates. I noticed that we also have classes for a Cisco short term certificate which is interesting to me as well. 
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
An Organization that would be useful for me on my resume would be the Phi Thetta Kappa Organization. They would be beneficial because they are an hours program so employers might look at this and see that and possibly consider me over other people. 
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The purpose of the CPU is that it functions as the brain of a computler. The ALU performs all of the math inside of a CPU. 
When using a self-checkout machine at a grocery store, you are using a big computer to check out. It does many different tasks as well. The main 4 functions of a computer are imput, store, process, and output. You are imputting your items barcodes on the scanner and you then imput your payment method. The machine stores all your items bercodes and payment info in its system temporarly. The machine then processes the items scanned and calulates the price using the ALU. Then it outputs with finalizing your order and giving you a reciept.  
#### Gates and Circuits
A truth table is a table that shows every possible output for all of your inputs you put in. An AND Gate is that your imputs have to be the same to get the same output. An OR Gate is a gate that doesn't matter if you have the same 2 inputs, you can still have the same output.
#### IEEE
IEEE's core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. In their code of ethics, they commit to uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. They also state to To treat all persons fairly and with respect, to not engage in harassment or discrimination, and to avoid injuring others. Lastly, they say they strive to ensure this code is upheld by colleagues and co-workers.
#### Storage
Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek. The disk transfer rate is the time it takes from data to go from the disk to the system. 
The difference between SSD's and Traditional Hard Drives is that SSD's use chips that use flash memory which is much faster than the regular hard drive. 
#### Memory
The Ram is important because it is used so that way computers can access data and actually be able to use and run the data. By increasing your RAM, you are decreasing the amount of time that the data has to go from the hard drive and back which then in turn will make your computer process way faster. The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths is how much data is transfered in 1 clock cycle. This also affects the speed of the computer based on the bit paths you have. 
A difference between RAM and hard disk storage is that RAM moves things much faster than the hard disk. Another difference is that the RAM does not hold data for long periods of time. The hard disk storage is what is used for holding data for long periods of time unlike the RAM. 
#### Data Representation
Decimal representation is showing a number in decimal form aka. Base 10 (ex.1450)
Binary representation is showing a number in the form of 1's and 0's/ only 2 digits (ex.10011001)
Hexadecimal representation has a base of 16/ has 16 digits. (ex. 0123456789ABCDEF)

4BinaryConversion: conversion of binary form to decimal form 
The color being shown is a custom color with the description name "Vivied Violet". This color could be problematic because it is a custom color so people would not know the true identity of the color.
